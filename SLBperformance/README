Functions in DecodedSLBAnalysis.cc
uses the output of SLBdecoded2ROOT.cc
//----------------------------------------
Analyzes ALL SLABS at the same time.
Examples of how to run the different functions are in

- Proto.cc  --> Pedestal + MIP analysis
- DummyDisplay.cc --> Save some 3D plots with a simplistic event building
- Monitoring.cc --> Dummy Monitoring tools. More for Debugging that for monitoring so far.

//----------------------------------------
Analyzes SINGLE SLABS.
Examples of how to run the different functions are in SingleSlabAnalysis.cc

To run it you need to create the following folders:

results_mipcalibration
results_pedestal
results_retriggers
// ---------------------------------

1)    PedestalAnalysis(TString slboard,TString sufix,TString map_filename, int maxnhit);
Saves a pedestal txt file for all channels/sca and 2d maps.
slboard == slboard name
sufix = sufix of the output file


2)    FindMasked(TString dif);
In development
And algorithm that finds the masked channels.
USE ONLY WITH THE FULL SCAN FILE (it expects that all chips have received beam data moreless homogeneusly).

3)    ReadMap(TString filename);
Read a chip-chn to x-y map and saves the coordinates. 

4)    ReadMasked(TString filename);
Read and save the info of masked channels.  


5) SignalAnalysis(TString slboard, TString outputname, TString map_filename, int maxnhit);
Main Function.
Same arguments that the PedestalAnalysis but it uses as input a pedestal txt file.
Reads the files and subtract the pedestal to signal and calculates mip positions and signal over noie ratios for all channels.

6) Retriggers (TString slboard, TString outputname, TString map_filename, int maxnhit)
Funtion under construction.
Only the first 5 histograms saved are been used so far...
